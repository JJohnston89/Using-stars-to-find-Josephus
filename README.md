# Using-stars-to-find-Josephus

A fun little project to solve the Josephus Problem using stars instead of people.

There are n stars dancing around a circle having fun. The counting out begins at some point in the circle 
and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction. In each step, a certain number of stars are skipped, 
and the next star starts to get exhausted, and burns out leaving behind a tomb stone. 
The stars one by one burn out until one star remains and the party stops.

Here's an example: There are 7 stars numbered 1 through 7, and you start at 1 and count off by threes.
Stars will burned out in the order 4, 1, 6, 5, 7, 3. Number 2 will be left. 

All the art work was created by me using MS Paint, and yeah, I know the star is somewhat creepy. =P
