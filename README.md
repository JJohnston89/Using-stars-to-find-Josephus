# Using-stars-to-find-Josephus

A fun little project to solve the Josephus Problem using stars instead of people.

There are n stars dancing around a circle having fun. The counting out begins at some point in the circle 
and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction. In each step, a certain number of stars are skipped, 
and the next star starts to get exhausted, and burns out leaving behind a tomb stone. 
The stars one by one burn out until one star remains and the party stops.

All the art work was created by me using MS Paint, and yeah, I know the star is somewhat creepy. =P
